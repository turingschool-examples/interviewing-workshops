# Live Coding Interview Workshop

## üíª Solo Instructions:

1. Prepare to record yourself. Use a tool such as QuickTime, Zoom, etc.
2. Select a challenge to complete.
    1. Pick a challenge from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) 
    2. Pick a challenge from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
    3. Pick a challenge from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
    4. Pick a challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
    5. Pick a challenge that isn't exercise based but instead real-world based. For example, you might be asked to fix bugs in an existing codebase or you might be asked to add a new feature. **NOTE:** These exercises take much more time! While it's possible you'll have to complete a large challenge like this, it's more likely they'll have you work until a certain amount of time has passed and you aren't expected to complete all of it.

## ‚úÖ What's the goal of this? 

The goal is to help individuals and groups identify areas for improvement through the use of a rubric. Some companies utilize rubrics in their interview process, as well. 

The benefit is primarily in the act of assessing and getting feedback. Then, use that feedback in future practice.
