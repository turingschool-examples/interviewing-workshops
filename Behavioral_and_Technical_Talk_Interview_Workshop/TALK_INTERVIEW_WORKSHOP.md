## ‚úÖ What's the goal of this? 

The goal is to help individuals and groups identify areas for improvement through the use of a rubric. Some companies utilize rubrics in their interview process, as well. 

The benefit is primarily in the act of assessing and getting feedback. Then, use that feedback in future practice.
