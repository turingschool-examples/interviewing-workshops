# What's the value in self-assessment or peer-assessment?

- develops self-directed learning
- increases motivation
- provides immediate feedback
- grows personal responsibility
- develops judgement skills

Some benefits to peer assessment are:

# Considerations & Notes:

### Feedback is difficult

- 'Google' "how to give helpful constructive feedback" or "how to give good feedback to peers" to learn how to give great feedback.
- 'Google' "how to take feedback" to learn how to take feedback. 
- Read a book about feedback: Nonviolent Communication, Radical Candor, Thanks for the Feedback.

### Assessing is the most important part of this activity

- Practicing a skill a lot can be futile if you're practicing in the wrong way or practicing the wrong thing. By observing and objectively making judgements about the performance, you can use the feedback generated from that observation to improve. 
- To learn more about skill building, consider reading: Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better
