###  What's the value in self-assessment or peer-assessment? 

The workshop activities are centered around a rubric so that you can self-assess or you can be assessed by your peers. 

Feel free to 'Google' "self-assessment scholarly article" and "peer assessment scholarly article" to read some great research on these topics. 

Some benefits to self-assessment are:

- promotes the skills of reflective practice and self-monitoring
- develops self-directed learning
- increases motivation
- provides immediate feedback
- grows personal responsibility
- develops judgement skills
- improves feedback sills
- improves metacognition
- **improves your performance in whatever skill you are assessing**

Some benefits to peer assessment are: 

- develops feedback skills
- enhances learning through knowledge diffusion and exchange of ideas
- improves motivation
- improves complex solving problem skills
- immediate feedback
- improves metacognition
- **improves your performance in whatever skill you are assessing**

### Feedback is difficult

- 'Google' "how to give helpful constructive feedback" or "how to give good feedback to peers" to learn how to give great feedback.
- 'Google' "how to take feedback" to learn how to take feedback. 
- Read a book about feedback: Nonviolent Communication, Radical Candor, Thanks for the Feedback.
- Generally, feedback should be kind, actionable, and constructive. This doesn't mean you need to sugar-coat your feedback, it just means you need to use your communication skills to get your point accross in a way that will allow the receiver to utilize the feedback successfully. 
- Consider researching 'Growth Mindset'

### Assessing is the most important part of the workshops activities

- Practicing a skill can be futile if you're practicing in the wrong way or practicing the wrong thing. By observing and objectively making judgements about the performance, you can use the feedback generated from that observation to improve. 
- To learn more about skill building, consider reading: Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better

### Why is this a GitHub repository and not an article? 

- You can contribute and interact.
  - Contributions look good on your GitHub profile. Your GitHub profile is a factor in your job hunt!
  - Your contributions can help this repo improve and be more helpful to others who are hunting for work. 
  - If you want feedback on something, open an issue!
- I know that each developer at Turing has a GitHub account and is familiar with using GitHub. That is not the case for other tools.
